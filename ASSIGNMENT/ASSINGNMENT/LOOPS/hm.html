    <h2>What are loops?</h2>
    <h3>for loop:</h3>
    <p1>The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate.<br>
        It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration statement.
      </p1><br>
      <br>
<p1>for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  </p1><br><br>
    <h3>while loop:</h3>
    <p1>The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
      </p1><br>
      <br>
<p1>let i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
      console.log(i);
      i++;
    }
    
  </p1><br><br>
    <h3>do-while loop:</h3>
    <p1>Similar to the while loop, the do-while loop executes a block of code at least once,<br>and then it repeats as long as a specified condition is true.
      </p1><br>
      <br>
<p1>let i = 0;
    do {
      console.log(i);
      i++;
    } while (i < 5);   
  </p1><br><br>
    <h3>for-each loop:</h3>
    <p1>In JavaScript, the forEach loop is a method for iterating over elements in an array.<br> It provides a more concise and readable way to iterate through each element compared to traditional for loops.<br> The forEach method is available on arrays and takes a callback function as its argument. <br>
        This callback function is executed once for each element in the array.
      <br><br>
<p1>const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    array.forEach(function(element) {
      // code to be executed for each element
      console.log(element);
    });
    
  </p1><br><br>
  
  <h2>What is an arrow function?</h2>
  <h3>Arrow Function:</h3>
  <p1>Arrow functions in JavaScript provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions,<br>with implicit return for single expressions, and lexically bind the this keyword.
    <br><br>
<p1>array.forEach((element, index, array) => {
    console.log(`Element at index ${index}: ${element}`);
  });

</p1><br><br>

<h2>What is map function in js?</h2>
<h3>Map Function:</h3>
<p1>In JavaScript, the map function is an array method that creates a new array by applying a provided function to<br> each element of the original array. It doesn't mutate the original array. The result is an array with the same length, where each element<br>
     corresponds to the result of the applied function on the original element.</p1>
